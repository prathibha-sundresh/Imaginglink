To enable 2FA, you need to register your mobile phone number by providing the country code and phone number. A 6 digit authentication code (OTP-one time password) will be sent to your registered mobile phone number via text message (SMS) for verification. This code needs to be entered on the website/app for verification purpose. If the code is matched, then the mobile phone number will be registered to your account. Once registered, you need password as well as a new authentication code that will be sent to your registered mobile phone number for every login to your Imaginglink’s account. Note: Imaginglink doesn't charge you for using text messages (SMS) for two-factor authentication. However, your mobile provider's standard rates for sending and receiving messages still apply."
